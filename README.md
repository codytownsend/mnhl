# NHL Shots on Goal Prediction System

A production-ready system for predicting player-level Shots on Goal (SOG) distributions in NHL games, with calibrated uncertainty quantification.

## North Star

**We win by consistently estimating each player's probability distribution of SOG for tonight's game—good enough to price common lines (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5), quantify uncertainty, and spot mispriced markets.**

## Philosophy

- **Distribution-first**: Model full probability distributions, not point estimates
- **Calibration is king**: Well-calibrated uncertainty > sharp but dishonest predictions
- **No data leakage**: All predictions reproducible from pre-game snapshot
- **Public data only**: NHL API + derived features, no proprietary sources
- **Small, compounding edges**: Repeatable system beats one-off "sure things"

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd nhl_sog_predictor

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Edit `config/model_config.yaml` to customize:
- Data sources and caching
- Feature engineering parameters
- Model hyperparameters
- Validation splits
- Calibration method

### Training a Model

```bash
# Collect historical data and train model
python train_model.py --config config/model_config.yaml

# Force refresh data from API
python train_model.py --refresh-data

# Skip baseline training (faster)
python train_model.py --skip-baselines
```

Training workflow:
1. Collects historical data from NHL API (2023-present)
2. Splits into train/val/test (time-based)
3. Trains baseline models (season mean, EWMA, opponent-adjusted)
4. Trains LightGBM model (two-headed: mu + alpha)
5. Fits calibrator on validation set
6. Evaluates on test set
7. Saves model artifacts

### Generating Daily Predictions

```bash
# Predict for today's games
python -c "from src.data_pipeline.pipeline import run_daily_predictions; run_daily_predictions()"

# Predict for specific date
python scripts/predict_today.py --date 2025-01-15
```

Output includes:
- Player name, position, team
- Distribution parameters (mu, alpha)
- Probabilities for common lines (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5)
- Confidence intervals (10th, 50th, 90th percentiles)
- Projected TOI and lineup confidence

### Example Output

```csv
player_name,position,mu,p10,p50,p90,p_over_2.5,projected_toi,lineup_confidence
Connor McDavid,C,3.2,1,3,6,0.5234,21.5,0.95
Nathan MacKinnon,C,3.0,1,3,5,0.4876,21.2,0.92
Auston Matthews,C,2.8,1,3,5,0.4523,20.8,0.88

### Data Flow

```
NHL API → Historical Data → Feature Engineering → Model → Calibration → Predictions
         ↓                   ↓                     ↓        ↓            ↓

## Model Details

### Features

**Player Usage (Base Rate)**
- TOI per game (L5, L10, L20, season, EWMA)
- EV/PP/SH TOI breakdown
- PP unit designation (PP1/PP2)
- Line number inference

**Shooting Tendency**
- Shots per game (various windows)
- Individual Corsi For per 60 (iCF/60)
- Individual Shots For per 60 (iSF/60)
- Shooting percentage

**Matchup Context**
- Opponent shots allowed per 60
- Opponent shot quality (distance, type)
- Expected game pace (team + opponent)

**Situational**
- Home/away
- Rest days, back-to-backs
- Travel distance
- Venue bias (scorekeeper effects)

### Model: LightGBM → Negative Binomial

**Architecture:**
- **Mu Model**: Predicts expected SOG (Poisson objective)
- **Alpha Model**: Predicts dispersion (Gamma objective, trained on residuals)
- Output: Full NB distribution P(SOG = k)

**Why Negative Binomial?**
- Over-dispersed count data (variance > mean)
- Naturally models shot-taking variability
- Closed-form for probabilities over lines

**Uncertainty Inflation:**
Automatically widens distributions when:
- Player has < 10 games
- Projected TOI uncertainty > 3 minutes
- Lineup confidence < 0.7

### Calibration

**Method:** Isotonic regression (default)

Ensures predicted probabilities match empirical frequencies:
- If we predict 60% for Over 2.5, ~60% of those predictions should hit
- Applied per line (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5)
- Refitted weekly to track model drift

**Evaluation:**
- Calibration curves (predicted vs actual frequency)
- Coverage tests (do 80% CIs contain actual ~80% of time?)

## Validation

### Time-Based Splits

```
Train:  2023-10-01 to 2024-10-31
Val:    2024-11-01 to 2024-11-30
Test:   2024-12-01 to 2025-01-31
```

7-day purge between splits to avoid leakage.

### Metrics (Priority Order)

1. **CRPS** (Continuous Ranked Probability Score) - Primary
2. **Brier Scores** - For Over/Under at common lines
3. **Calibration Error** - Distance between predicted and empirical probabilities
4. **Coverage** - Do confidence intervals contain actuals at expected rates?

### Baselines to Beat

- **Season Mean**: Player's average SOG
- **EWMA**: Exponentially weighted moving average
- **Opponent Adjusted**: Season mean × opponent suppression factor

**Acceptance Criteria:** Model must beat best baseline CRPS on test set.

## Production Workflow

### Daily Prediction (T-90 minutes before games)

1. Fetch tonight's schedule
2. Get team rosters
3. Pull historical stats (as_of timestamp enforced)
4. Generate features
5. Run model → get (mu, alpha) for each player
6. Apply calibration
7. Calculate probabilities for common lines
8. Export predictions (JSON/CSV)

### Weekly Retraining (Sunday)

1. Fetch results from past week
2. Update historical database
3. Retrain model on rolling window
4. Refit calibrator
5. Evaluate against last week's predictions
6. Check for degradation (CRPS, calibration error)
7. Save new model version if improved

### Monitoring

**Alerts triggered if:**
- CRPS increases > 15% (model degradation)
- Calibration error > 0.08 (predictions becoming dishonest)
- Coverage deviation > 0.15 (CIs no longer reliable)

## Advanced Usage

### Feature Importance Analysis

```python
from src.modeling.lgbm_model import LGBMNegativeBinomialModel

model = LGBMNegativeBinomialModel()
model.load(Path('models/v20250115_crps'))

# Get top features
importance = model.get_feature_importance('mu', top_n=20)
print(importance)
```

### Custom Hyperparameter Tuning

```python
config_override = {
    'mu': {
        'learning_rate': 0.03,
        'num_leaves': 63
    }
}

model = LGBMNegativeBinomialModel(config_override=config_override)
```

### Subgroup Analysis

```python
from src.validation.metrics import MetricsCalculator

calculator = MetricsCalculator()

# Analyze by position
metrics_by_position = calculator.evaluate_by_subgroup(
    predictions_df, actuals_df, subgroup_col='position'
)
```

### Batch Predictions

```python
from src.data_pipeline.pipeline import PredictionPipeline

pipeline = PredictionPipeline()

# Predict multiple dates
dates = pd.date_range('2025-01-15', '2025-01-22')
for date in dates:
    predictions = pipeline.generate_predictions_for_date(date)
    pipeline.save_predictions(predictions, f'preds_{date:%Y%m%d}.parquet')
```

## FAQs

**Q: Why Negative Binomial instead of Poisson?**  
A: SOG has variance > mean (over-dispersed). Poisson assumes variance = mean, underestimating tails. NB explicitly models this with dispersion parameter.

**Q: Why two separate models (mu and alpha)?**  
A: Easier to optimize and interpret than joint likelihood. Mu captures expected shots, alpha captures variance/uncertainty.

**Q: How do you handle scratches/lineup changes after prediction?**  
A: Predictions are timestamped. If player scratched after as_of time, mark prediction invalid. Production system would need lineup monitoring.

**Q: What about overtime shots?**  
A: Configurable via `include_ot_shots` parameter. Most betting lines include OT.

**Q: Can this work for goals instead of shots?**  
A: Yes, but goals are lower-frequency (more zero-inflated), may need hurdle model. Same framework applies.
